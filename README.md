# Project
*RSA Encryption with Huffman Coding and LSB Steganography*

**Description**


This project implements RSA encryption, Huffman coding, and Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography techniques. 
It allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using RSA encryption, compress the encrypted text using Huffman coding and hide the compressed text within images using LSB steganography.

**Features**



●  RSA encryption with key generation
●  Huffman coding for text compression
●  LSB steganography for hiding compressed text in images
